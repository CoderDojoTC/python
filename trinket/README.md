# Trinket Tutorials
This directory has a list of tutorials created by the trinket.io web site.

Trinket is popular with educators because it has a high-quality integration of a turtle graphics web library.

Please contact Dan McCreary if you have samples that you would like to submit.

If you are teacher and would like specific content created for your cirriculum we are interested in hearing from you.
