This includes hints on getting your Python environments setup up and extensive lesson plans for serveral enviornments. Our mentors have used several different envornments for teaching Python. They each have pros and cons. What our mentors like is getting new students started using a graphical programming environment such as turtle graphics libraries. Here are some of our favorite tools: Trinket.io is an easy-to use, kid friendly web-based turtle graphics for beginners. Jupyter Notebooks also have some support for turtle graphics. Jupyter Notebooks can be tricky to setup for the first time, but they are the perfect on-ramp for teaching data literacy. Raspberry Pi - The Raspberry Pi foundation has selected Python as its primary tool for teaching programming. If you have a Raspberry Pi there are many resources for you. Trinket and Jupyter Notebooks will also run on many Raspberry Pi devices. Robots Our students love robots. Python is also the preferred language in many robotics courses. Today we teach beginning robotics with Scratch and Arduino, but we continue to investigate systems like Raspberry Pi robots that can be programmed with Python. Let us know if you have any low-cost kid friendly ideas. We have tested the JetBot and other robots and we continue to look for solutions. Now lets briefly go into the pros and cons of these systems. Learning Python with Trinket \u00b6 We use the trinket.io web site to teach our introduction to python. Trinket has a nice turtle graphics library which is ideal for fast visual feedback. Because it is a free and a pure web web based environment it meets the criteria for our courses. There is no complex setup and each student can continue to do development when they are at home. The downside of Trinket is it has limited functionality, only supports Python 2.X in the free version and you must have an internet connection to use Trinket. If you need Python 3.X web version you can use the free repl.id web site. Learning Python with Jupyter Notebooks \u00b6 You can also use Jupyter Notebooks to draw turtle graphics. The notebook will open a new window to draw your turtle graphis. Getting Jupyter Notebooks is a bit tricky to setup on many PCs. However, once it is setup it offers tens of thousands of sample programs to learn python coding. Jupyter Notebooks are also the preferred tool by many data science professionals. An example of a Jupyter Notebook that uses turtle graphs is here Learning Python with Raspberry Pi \u00b6 If you have a Rasperry Pi there are many great ways to learn Python. One of first things is to try out one of the Python development environments for the Raspberry Pi. Learning Python with Robots \u00b6 Right now we are continuing to try to find the right combination of easy-of-use and low-cost robots to teach python. If you hear of any good tools, please let us know. Target Audience \u00b6 Learning Python is ideal for students that have good keyboarding skills. If students have difficulty with doing functions like copy and pasting text we suggest they start with a block-programming language like Scratch. List of Concepts \u00b6 Here are some of the concepts we will be learning in this course. If you are already familiar with these concepts you can skip over some of the labs. importing libraries We need to tell Pyhton what functions we want to use. We will use the import function to tell Python which functions we need to use in our programs. drawing Turtle graphs has a set of drawing functions. We will learn to use these to draw patterns on the screen. square walk - teach your turtle to walk in a square and draw figures. variables Variables make our programs easier to read and easier to understand. loops Loops help use when we have many tasks that we repeat over and over. conditionals Conditionals allow us to change our behavior based on rules we create. functions Functions allow us to break large programs into chunks that we can give names and can call over and over. function parameters Functions can also take parameters to change the behavior of a function. random numbers Random number functions allow our programs to have the computer select new random number between a range of numbers. lists Lists alow us to create collections of names. inputs Inputs allow us to prompt the user for values. recursion Recursion allows us to have programs call themselves to create repeating patterns. modules Once you have a group of related functions you can put them all together into a module. This makes it easier for others to reuse your programs. Contributing to Our Library \u00b6 Do you have a specific example you would like to share with other students and teachers?

So we don't yet have any paid staff to curate new content. However, we do value your input and will consider all contributions as our volunteer time permits. We especially value teachers that would like to integrate coding, data science and AI into your classrooms in new and innovative ways. Using Standard Git Pull Requests \u00b6 The best way to contribute is to send use your sample programs using a standard GitHub pull request method. This allow us to view all the changes you are proposing and give you feedback. This is a three step process. 1. The first step will require you to have your own github account. You can go to our github home page and look for the \"fork\" icon. When you click that it will make a \"virutal copy\" in your own github area. 2. You can then add your content to that repository and do all the testing there. 3. Once you have everything tested you can click the \"Submit Pull Request\". This process will notify our team your additon is pending. We will review these new submission and if everything looks OK we will accept your changes. We might suggest a few changes the first time you send us a pull request. Don't take this personally. We want to make working on-line togeher as semaless as possible and helping put the right sections in place to start is a normal part of working in teams on line. Good Lesson Plans \u00b6 A good contribution has some, but not necessarily all of the following: Context - where does this lession fit into our overall cirriculum? Would it normally follow after an existing lession or is it a standalone lesson? Concepts - what concept will be taught in this lesson. We try to keep to the idea of \"One concept per lesson\". So think about what is the minimum amount of code to learn a new concept. Learning Objective - what are the goals of this lession. These are typically written as \"After this lesson the student...: Difficulty Level - is it a Beginner, Intermediate or Difficult concept? For example drawing a square with a turtle is a Beginner concept. Recursion is a Difficult concept. Sample Code - Please provide working sample code that you have tested whenever possible. We encourage you to put in in-line comments when possible. To use our test highlighter for Python code, please place your code in a block sourrounded by back quotes.

The code for this lesson can be found here . But What Is Machine Learnig? \u00b6 Process of determining the function that gives a plausible result y for a set of inputs, in form of a vector x . In its simplest form, this could be linear regression, where we find the line of best fit through the data. In more complex forms, however, this can be training a neural network to fit very non-linear data. We will use a type of neural network to recognize our handwritten numbers. Types of Neural Networks \u00b6 As you can see, there are many different types, or architectures of neural networks. Some of the most common are Feed Forward, Recurrent, LSTM, and AutoEncoder neural networks. The other most common is the one that we will use, or a Convolutional Neural Network. Convolutional Neural Network \u00b6 Since we have image data, we will use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A CNN works by sliding \"windows\" over the input image and aggregating nearby pixels together. Importing Packages \u00b6 For this project, we will be using a machine learning package called Keras. This makes it really easy to construct our neural network. We also import matplotlib to visualize our data, and numpy for some utilities. import keras from keras.datasets import mnist # Get dataset from keras.models import Sequential from keras.layers import Dense , Dropout , Flatten # Need these types of layers from keras.layers import Conv2D , MaxPooling2D # Need convolutional layers import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.image as mpimg import numpy as np Loading Data \u00b6 Important to load both a training and testing set to make sure the CNN is not \"memorizing\" the set of images it will train on. This would lead to awful accuracy in the \"real world\" # input image dimensions (pixels) img_rows , img_cols = 28 , 28 # the data, split between train and test sets ( x_train , y_train ), ( x_test , y_test ) = mnist . load_data () # manipulate the data for the CNN x_train = x_train . reshape ( x_train . shape [ 0 ], img_rows , img_cols , 1 ) x_test = x_test . reshape ( x_test . shape [ 0 ], img_rows , img_cols , 1 ) input_shape = ( img_rows , img_cols , 1 ) Preprocessing Data \u00b6 We want to have our CNN work with numbers between 0 and 1. Since pixel values are from 0-255, we divide all numbers by 255 in order to make them between 0 and 1. We then can see how many training and testing samples we have. x_train = x_train . astype ( 'float32' ) x_test = x_test . astype ( 'float32' ) x_train /= 255 x_test /= 255 print ( 'x_train shape:' , x_train . shape ) print ( x_train . shape [ 0 ], 'train samples' ) print ( x_test . shape [ 0 ], 'test samples' ) Look At Data \u00b6 In the next few cells, we will look at an example of a digit and see what number it is in the training set. x_train [ 0 ] pixels = x_train [ 0 ] . reshape (( 28 , 28 )) plt . imshow ( pixels , cmap = 'gray' ) print ( y_train [ 0 ]) Desired Output \u00b6 We want to convert the desired output from a number n to a vector where the nth element is 1 and the rest are 0. Example: n = 5 Resulting Vector = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0} num_classes = 10 y_train = keras . utils . to_categorical ( y_train , num_classes ) y_test = keras . utils . to_categorical ( y_test , num_classes ) Define Model \u00b6 Now here is the fun part. Building the model! We will have a 5 layer neural network. Feel free to play around with some of the parameters and see what works better or worse! model = Sequential () model . add ( Conv2D ( 32 , kernel_size = ( 3 , 3 ), activation = 'relu' , input_shape = input_shape )) model . add ( Conv2D ( 64 , ( 3 , 3 ), activation = 'relu' )) model . add ( MaxPooling2D ( pool_size = ( 2 , 2 ))) model . add ( Dropout ( 0.25 )) # Prevent overfitting model . add ( Flatten ()) model . add ( Dense ( 128 , activation = 'relu' )) model . add ( Dropout ( 0.5 )) model . add ( Dense ( num_classes , activation = 'softmax' )) model . summary () Set Parameters \u00b6 Here, we will set two parameters for the network. The first is batch size, which determines how many training examples we will look at before changing the weights in the model. We will also set the number of epochs, or iterations through the entire training set. batch_size = 128 # How many training examples will we look at before updating the weights in the matrix epochs = 12 # How many times we will run through the complete training set Compile and Train Model \u00b6 Here, we compile the model and then train it. A couple things to note. We are using the Adam optimizer, as compared to others such as stochastic gradient descent. We are measuring the success of the model through the categorical crossentropy loss metric, which determines how to adjust the weights within the model. model . compile ( loss = keras . losses . categorical_crossentropy , optimizer = keras . optimizers .

We will do this by running through our test set and having the model produce a prediction. Thankfully, there is already a function built into the model for this. score = model . evaluate ( x_test , y_test , verbose = 0 ) print ( 'Test loss:' , score [ 0 ]) print ( 'Test accuracy:' , score [ 1 ]) Let's see what happens on an individual image level: to_predict = np . array ([ x_test [ 0 ]]) output = model . predict ( to_predict ) pixels = to_predict [ 0 ] . reshape (( 28 , 28 )) plt . imshow ( pixels , cmap = 'gray' ) output np . argmax ( output ) And there you have it!

Note that you can do the first four lessons using web-based Python programming tools like Trinket.io or repl.it. Starting with lesson #5 on Files you will need to have Python installed on your local computer. Please visit the Python.org web site for the installation instructions on your operating systems. You can use the command-line version of Python from a Terminal or shell or you can install one of the Python Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). The concepts in this course include: Variables and Scope - In this lab we learn that you can control what parts of your program can access a variable. This comes in handy when we write larger programs. Data types - This lab give you a tour of some of the data types in Python other than boring strings and integers. Checking Data Types of Function Parameters - in the beginning course we learned how to pass parameters to functions. Now we learn how to make sure our functions get the data that they expect! Maps - Maps or dictionaries are sets of key-value pairs that are crazy flexible. Unlike a list, where the index can only be fixed sequence of integers starting with 0, the keys in a map can be any integer or string in any order. Files - In this lesson we will learn how to open a file and read the data into our program with just a few lines. Not only can we read in data, but we can also write out data! So much power in a few lines of code! Images - In our CoderDojo AI Racing League we will be learning how to make a car drive autonomously.

It really takes the mystery out of what functions you can use and avoids trying to guess what function names are used. Not that guessing games aren't fun! Regular expressions - You sometimes want a list of all the files in a folder that have a .jpg extension for images.

Let's dive a little deeper into the world of variables! Naming conventions \u00b6 In the Python community , the general accepted format for variable and function names is all lower case, with multiple words separated by underscores. For example: variable = 0 my_variable = 0 my_function_name() Giving variables and functions meaningful names \u00b6 Variable names should be meaningful to you as the programmer, to any other developers that may be collaborating with you and any developers that may look at your code in the future. Below are two instances of the same code using different variable and function names. Which is easier to read? def my_first_function ( arg ): variable1 = arg + 2 return variable1 def my_second_function ( arg ): variable = arg * 5 return variable print ( my_first_function ( my_second_function ( 5 ))) def plus_two ( num ): two_more = num + 2 return two_more def times_five ( num ): five_times = num * 5 return five_times print ( plus_two ( times_five ( 5 ))) Variable Scope \u00b6 A variable's scope refers to where in your code you can access that variable. The scope of a variable defined within a function is limited to the function in which it is defined. This is an example of a local variable. For example, using the more legible code above: def plus_two ( num ): two_more = num + 2 return two_more def times_five ( num ): five_times = num * 5 return five_times print ( plus_two ( times_five ( 5 ))) print ( five_times ) Attempting to print the value of five_times within the global scope of the code will result in a NameError, because the scope of the variable five_times is limited to the times_five function. Conversely, a global variable is a variable that can be accessed anywhere within your code. Global variables are usually created within the main body of your code, that is outside of functions, as demonstrated below. You can see the my_name variable is accessible within the who_is_awesome function. my_name = \"Zack\" def who_is_awesome (): print ( my_name + \" is awesome!\" ) You can make a variable used within a function globally accessible by using the 'global' keyword. For example, def who_is_awesome ( name ): global awesome_statement awesome_statement = name + \" is awesome!\" print ( \"Variable Reference Within Function: \" + awesome_statement ) who_is_awesome ( \"Zack\" ) print ( \"Global Variable Use: \" + awesome_statement ) Food for Thought \u00b6 When would it make sense to use the global keyword within a function to make a variable globally accessible, instead of returning the variable from the function?","title":"Variables and Scope"},{"location":"intermediate/01-variables-scope/#variables","text":"If you've made it this far, you know a variable is a container for data in Python.

Although many of these labs use Trinket, some of the labs in the intermediate class need access to your local file system to learn how to open and manipulate files. To do this you must install Python on your local computer. To install Python on your computer visit the Python.org web site and follow the installation instructions for your computer operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux etc.) At this point you should now have python installed on your computer and no longer be using trinket.io. We recommend installing Anaconda and using the Spyder integrated development environment (IDE). Python makes it easy to read and write text files. The general syntax for opening a file is as follows: file = open('/file/path/filename.txt', 'mode') The first argument is the path the file on your computer. If the file you're trying to open is in the same folder as your python script you can just input the filename, if not you'll need the path to file. For example, let's say you're using a Mac, your username is Bella, and you're trying to open a file called \"myfile.txt\" in your downloads folder. The path to that file would be: /Users/Bella/Downloads/myfile.txt Valid arguments for the mode parameter are: 'w': writing to a file, this will overwrite a file if it already exists. 'a': append to a file, you can add new lines to a file that already exists, otherwise it will create the file. 'r': to read a file.

Regular expressions are handy whenever you have one ore more strings and you want to detect if a specific patten of characters appears in that string. Regular expressions are mostly standardized so that if you use them other developers will quickly be able to read this the patten notation and understand the function of the pattern. Finding four digits in an input string \u00b6 Let's take a simple example. What if you want an input to to a function to contain four digits. The string \\d matches a single digit. Here is the python program to check to see if there are four consecutive digits in an input string: import re my_input = '1234' # check to see if there are four consecutive digits somewhere in the input digits_test = re . search ( '\\d\\d\\d\\d' , my_input ) if digits_test : print ( \"We have four digits!\" ) else : print ( \"Invalid data\" ) Run the regex-01 program on Trinket.io If you run the program as-is, it will tell you that the string '1234' will pass the test and the string We have four digits , but if you change the my_input to be 123x then the Invalid data will be returned. The name of the regular expression module is just \"re\". We must have an import this line with the \"re\" module at the start of our program. The key line has re.search() function with two parameters. The first parameter is the regular expression and the second is the string to be tested. The exact way to read this line is: check to see if there are four consecutive digits somewhere in the input Note that if you put letters or spaces before or after the four digits the test will still pass. Finding exactly four digits \u00b6 What if you wanted exactly four digits? For example say you have a phone system that has exactly four-digit extensions. To do this you would need to also specify two additional characters: the start expression \"^\" and the end character \"$\" . Here is what that program would look like: import re my_input = '1234' # check to for exactly four digits digits_test = re . search ( '^\\d\\d\\d\\d$' , my_input ) if digits_test : print ( \"We have exactly four digits!\" ) else : print ( \"Invalid data\" ) Run the regex-02 program on Trinket.io Checking for one or more digits \u00b6 Sometimes we don't know exactly how many digits an input field should contain. We might just want to say \"look for one or more digits\". We can do this by using the '+' expression which says \"look for one or more of the previous expression\". Here is a program that will check for one or more digits: import re my_input = '1' # check for one or more digits digits_test = re . search ( '^\\d+' , my_input ) if digits_test : print ( \"We have one or more digits!\" ) else : print ( \"Invalid data\" ) Common regular expression characters for validating inputs \u00b6 Now that you have seen several examples of regular expressions, lets list some of the most common ones we use to validate input data.: Expression Meaning Example \\d A single digit in the range 0 to 9 '\\d\\d\\d' for validating '123' ^ The start of a string '^hello' $ The end of a string 'hello'$ [a-z] Any lowercase character in the range of 'a' to 'z' '[a-z]\\d\\d' will match 'x12' [A-Z] Any uppercase character in the range 'A' to 'Z' '\\d\\d[A-Z] will match '47N' . Zero or more occurrences of the previous expression '\\d.' would match an empty string, '1' or '12' + One or more occurrences of the previous expression '\\d+' would match '1' or '12' but would not match an empty string ** ** Or \\w Characters that typically make up words. This includes upper and lowercase charcters [a-z], [A-Z] and digits as well as the underscore \\w would match 'hello_world123' Note that there is an important difference between using the \"dot\" (period) and the \"plus\" characters. We use the dot when we want to check for an optional integer. We use the plus sign when we require an integer. When we are gathering information from users in a form, we often must be careful to specify what fields should require an integer input for the field to be valid. Combining Regular Expressions: Checking E-mail Address \u00b6 We can combine regular expressions to make more complicated expressions. For example here are some rules that form a simple e-mail address: a string of word characters the ampersand character '@' a string of additional word characters the period character '.' some additional characters such as 'com', 'edu' Here is a regular expression that does this: re . search ( '^\\w+@\\w+\\.\\w+$' , my_input ) Recall that the \\w+ character looks for one or more word characters. Note that we had to use a backslash in from of the period so it takes it as a literal period and not as a regular expression for zero-or-more of prior expression. Here is a program that prompts the user to input a valid e-mail: import re my_input = 'a@myco.com' # check for one or more digits if re . search ( '^\\w+@\\w+\\.\\w+$' , my_input ): print ( \"E-mail address valid\" ) else : print ( \"Error: Invalid email address!\" ) Finding The Right Regular Expression \u00b6 You often are confronted with validating complex fields like phone numbers, zip codes, and postal addresses. The good news is that many other people have also needed to do this and with a bit of searching you can probably find a regular expression that meets your needs. One of the best places to look for regular expressions is RegExLib . You can not only search for a regular expression but you can test it on common patterns. Other users have also voted on which regular expressions are their favorites. There are also categories of regular expressions such as: E-mails Dates and times Strings Numbers URI Addresses/Phone Markup Miscellaneous From Search to \u00b6 The re module offers a set of functions that allows us to search a string for a match: Function Description findall Returns a list containing all matches search Returns a Match object if there is a match anywhere in the string split Returns a list where the string has been split at each match sub Replaces one or many matches with a string Python Regular Expression References \u00b6 Python RegEx Cheat Sheet Python Regular Expressions HOWTO","title":"Regular Expressions"},{"location":"intermediate/09-regex/#regular-expressions-in-python","text":"A regular expression is a shorthand notation for describing a search pattern.

In this lesson we will use Trinket to learn how to use the popular matplotlib - a Python library for plotting data. This example uses the trigonometry function Sine. Don't worry if you have not taken a trigonometry yet. It is just a simple function that generates a wave of vertical height that range between -1 and 1 as we move down the X axis. Imagine a circle rotating and the sin() function will reflect the angle of a point on the edge of the circle going up and down and the circle turns. See the Wikipedia Article on Sine for a description of the function. How Matploglib works \u00b6 In order to get a plot of any function on the screen we need to first generate a list of points. Each point has an x and y coordinate and the point (0,0) is usually on the middle left corner of the screen. Trinket has a plotting area of about 200 by 200 pixels. So we will generate 200 points and plot them to get our chart. One of the best ways to get started is to create two lists: one of x coordinates and one of y coordinates like this: x_list = [] y_list = [] We then need to create a loop that has the x range change uniformly from 0 to 200 and then for each of these x values we will generate a y value and put them into the list. We will use the list.append() function to add these numbers in pairs to both the X and Y lists like this: for p in range ( 0 , 200 ): # we will use 200 points x_list . append ( p / 10 ) y_list . append ( math . sin ( p / 10 )) In this case \"p\" is just a temporary counter for each point we are going to add. We are also going to divide both the X and Y values by 10 so that we get the values from 0 to 20 (not 0 to 200). That way we can see how the sin() function varies in this range. Once we have our x and y points in two lists we are ready to plot. Here is how we use the matplot library: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ... plt.plot(x_list,y_list) plt.show() Each time we change the list values we need to run the plt.show() function to do the drawing. Full Example \u00b6 Here is a full working example. Note that we need to import the math library to use the sin() function. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import math x_list = [] y_list = [] for p in range(0,200): # we will use 200 points x_list.append(p/10) y_list.append(math.sin(p/10)) plt.title('Using matploglib.pyplot to show the sin(x) function from x=0 to 20') plt.xlabel('x') plt.ylabel('sin(x)') plt.plot(x_list,y_list) plt.show() Getting Fancy \u00b6 We can also put a grid axis and color on the plot: plot.grid(True, which='both')","title":"Using Trinket to Learn MatPlotLib"},{"location":"intermediate/12-plot-sin/#using-trinket-to-learn-matplotlib","text":"Python is notable for having a rich library of tools for viewing data.

Although many of these labs use Trinket, some of the labs in the intermediate class need access to your local file system to learn how to open and manipulate files. To do this you must install Python on your local computer. To install Python on your computer visit the Python.org web site and follow the installation instructions for your computer operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux etc.) At this point you should now have python installed on your computer and no longer be using trinket.io. We recommend installing Anaconda and using the Spyder integrated development environment (IDE). Python makes it easy to read and write text files. The general syntax for opening a file is as follows: file = open('/file/path/filename.txt', 'mode') The first argument is the path the file on your computer. If the file you're trying to open is in the same folder as your python script you can just input the filename, if not you'll need the path to file. For example, let's say you're using a Mac, your username is Bella, and you're trying to open a file called \"myfile.txt\" in your downloads folder. The path to that file would be: /Users/Bella/Downloads/myfile.txt Valid arguments for the mode parameter are: 'w': writing to a file, this will overwrite a file if it already exists. 'a': append to a file, you can add new lines to a file that already exists, otherwise it will create the file. 'r': to read a file. Reading Files \u00b6 For our example we're going to download Herman Melville's Moby-Dick from the Gutenberg Project to read. f = open ( \"/Users/Bella/Downloads/moby10b.txt\" , \"r\" ) ### Let's take all the lines in Moby-Dick and store them in a list! lines = f . readlines () ### Close the file f . close () Calling the .readlines() method on a file is very useful.

Although many of these labs use Trinket, some of the labs in the intermediate class need access to your local file system to learn how to open and manipulate files. To do this you must install Python on your local computer. To install Python on your computer visit the Python.org web site and follow the installation instructions for your computer operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux etc.) At this point you should now have python installed on your computer and no longer be using trinket.io. We recommend installing Anaconda and using the Spyder integrated development environment (IDE). Python makes it easy to read and write text files. The general syntax for opening a file is as follows: file = open('/file/path/filename.txt', 'mode') The first argument is the path the file on your computer. If the file you're trying to open is in the same folder as your python script you can just input the filename, if not you'll need the path to file. For example, let's say you're using a Mac, your username is Bella, and you're trying to open a file called \"myfile.txt\" in your downloads folder. The path to that file would be: /Users/Bella/Downloads/myfile.txt Valid arguments for the mode parameter are: 'w': writing to a file, this will overwrite a file if it already exists. 'a': append to a file, you can add new lines to a file that already exists, otherwise it will create the file. 'r': to read a file.","title":"Reading and Writing Files in Python"},{"location":"intermediate/21-files/#reading-files","text":"For our example we're going to download Herman Melville's Moby-Dick from the Gutenberg Project to read. f = open ( \"/Users/Bella/Downloads/moby10b.txt\" , \"r\" ) ### Let's take all the lines in Moby-Dick and store them in a list! lines = f . readlines () ### Close the file f . close () Calling the .readlines() method on a file is very useful.

A turtle is a drawing object that has position, direction, and a pen to draw as it moves around a grid. Turtle graphics are the preferred way to teach many concepts in computer science because they give you fast feedback. Fast feedback allows you to quickly see the errors in your code and correct them. For many of our introductory python labs, we will use the turtle python library. Although there are many different versions of the turtle library, most of the commands are similar. What you learn with the trinket python system will be useful in other systems also. Initialization commands \u00b6 There are three lines that will appear at the top of these labs: import turtle t = turtle . Turtle () t . shape ( 'turtle' ) The first line loads the turtle library into our program. The second creates a new turtle object called \"t\". The third line sets the shape to be a turtle. You don't have to use the name \"t\". You can set your turtle's name to be whatever you want. For example you can call your turtle \"sue\". import turtle sue = turtle . Turtle () sue . shape ( 'turtle' ) Just make sure you change all the names in the file to reference your new name. Moving the Turtle \u00b6 There are five ways to move your turtle around the screen. Our screen is around 400 points wide and 400 points high. The point (0,0) is at the center of our screen. The first four are relative movement commands. The last one will move the turtle to the absolute x and y location. t.forward(40) t.back(40) t.left(90) t.right(90) t.goto(x,y) Drawing \u00b6 There are several ways to draw virtual \"ink\" on the screen. The most common way is to just move your turtle around. It will draw a thin black line by default, but you can also change the pen color and the width of drawing. t.penup() - no drawing will happen when the pen is up t.pendown() - drawing will occur on the screen when the turtle moves t.color('red') - set the pen to a specific color t.pensize(5) - set the width of the pen from 1 to 20. 5 is a good size. t.begin_fill() - begin filling a region you draw around t.end_fill() - end the fill region Shapes \u00b6 There are also a few built-in drawing functions. The circle function that takes a single radius is an example of this. - t.circle(10) Misc \u00b6 There are also a few other miscellaneous things you can do. You can do some drawing and then clear the screen. t.clear() - clears the screen of all drawing t.hideturtle() - hides the turtle on the screen You can see a full list of the turtle commands here . Just click on the turtle area and scroll down. Generating a random number \u00b6 In addition to these drawing commands some of the exercises use random numbers. Here is how we do this: import random # get a random number between -200 and 200 myNumber = random . randint ( - 200 , 200 ) This will generate a random number from -200 to 200.

There are two things we do with equations in Python. The first is to use the equal sign to assign values on the left side of the equal sign to the values on the right side. The second thing we do is to compare values to the left and right of an operator. The result of a comparison is always TRUE or FALSE.

The test for ODD or EVEN is this: i % 2 In our previous loop lesson, we created an index that started at 1 and then changed to 2, 3 and finally 4. For 1 and 3, the first and third edges the result of divid by 2 will return 1 which is the same as TRUE.
