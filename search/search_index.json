List of Concepts \u00b6 Here are some of the concepts we will be learning in this course. If you are already familiar with these concepts you can skip over some of the labs. importing libraries We need to tell Pyhton what functions we want to use. We will use the import function to tell Python which functions we need to use in our programs. drawing Turtle graphs has a set of drawing functions. We will learn to use these to draw patterns on the screen. variables Variables make our programs easier to read and easier to understand. loops Loops help use when we have many tasks that we repeat over and over. conditionals Conditionals allow us to change our behavior based on rules we create. functions Functions allow us to break large programs into chunks that we can give names and can call over and over. function parameters Functions can also take parameters to change the behavior of a function. random numbers Random number functions allow our programs to have the computer select new random number between a range of numbers. lists Lists alow us to create collections of names. inputs Inputs allow us to prompt the user for values. recursion Recursion allows us to have programs call themselves to create repeating patterns. List of labs \u00b6 Our labs are working sample programs that you can try. You can learn by reading the sample programs and changing some values in the code. Each of the labs has experiments you can do to extend the code in various ways. turtle graphics simple square variables loops conditionals functions function parameters TODO random lists TODO inputs TODO recursion TODO [ square walk ] - teach your turtle to walk in a square [ distance variable ] - use a variable to store distance [ loops ] use a for loop to make the turtle go forward and turn four times.

A turtle is a drawing object that has position, direction and a pen to draw as it moves around a grid. They are a great way to teach students about the concepts of programming. Initializaton commands \u00b6 There are three lines that will appear at the top of these labs: 1 2 3 import turtle t = turtle . Turtle () t . shape ( 'turtle' ) The first line loads the turtle library into our program. The second creates a new turtle object called \"t\". The third line sets the shape to be a turtle. You don't have to use the name \"t\". You can set your turtle's name to be whatever you want. For example you can call your turtle \"sue\". 1 2 3 import turtle sue = turtle .

The point (0,0) is at the center of our screen. The first four are relative commands. The last one will move the turtle to the absolute x and y location. t.forward(40) t.back(40) t.left(90) t.right(90) t.goto(x,y) Drawing \u00b6 There are several ways to draw virtual \"ink\" on the screen.
