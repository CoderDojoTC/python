Jupyter Notebook \u00b6 You can also use Jupyter Notebooks to draw turtle graphics. The notebook will open a new window to draw your turtle graphis. Getting Jupyter Notebooks is a bit tricky to setup on many PCs. However, once it is setup it offers tens of thousands of sample programs to learn python coding.

Note: Students must have an Internet/web connection to use these labs. List of Concepts \u00b6 Here are some of the concepts we will be learning in this course. If you are already familiar with these concepts you can skip over some of the labs. importing libraries We need to tell Pyhton what functions we want to use. We will use the import function to tell Python which functions we need to use in our programs. drawing Turtle graphs has a set of drawing functions. We will learn to use these to draw patterns on the screen. square walk - teach your turtle to walk in a square and draw figures. variables Variables make our programs easier to read and easier to understand. loops Loops help use when we have many tasks that we repeat over and over. conditionals Conditionals allow us to change our behavior based on rules we create. functions Functions allow us to break large programs into chunks that we can give names and can call over and over. function parameters Functions can also take parameters to change the behavior of a function. random numbers Random number functions allow our programs to have the computer select new random number between a range of numbers. lists Lists alow us to create collections of names. inputs Inputs allow us to prompt the user for values. recursion Recursion allows us to have programs call themselves to create repeating patterns.

So we don't yet have any paid staff to curate new content. However, we do value your input and will consider all contributions as our volunteer time permits. We especially value teachers that would like to integrate coding, data science and AI into your classrooms in new and innovative ways. Using Standard Git Pull Requests \u00b6 The best way to contribute is to send use your sample programs using a standard GitHub pull request method. This allow us to view all the changes you are proposing and give you feedback. This is a three step process. 1. The first step will require you to have your own github account. You can go to our github home page and look for the \"fork\" icon. When you click that it will make a \"virutal copy\" in your own github area. 2. You can then add your content to that repository and do all the testing there. 3. Once you have everything tested you can click the \"Submit Pull Request\". This process will notify our team your additon is pending. We will review these new submission and if everything looks OK we will accept your changes. We might suggest a few changes the first time you send us a pull request. Don't take this personally. We want to make working on-line togeher as semaless as possible and helping put the right sections in place to start is a normal part of working in teams on line. Good Lesson Plans \u00b6 A good contribution has some, but not necessarily all of the following: Context - where does this lession fit into our overall cirriculum? Would it normally follow after an existing lession or is it a standalone lesson? Concepts - what concept will be taught in this lesson. We try to keep to the idea of \"One concept per lesson\". So think about what is the minimum amount of code to learn a new concept. Learning Objective - what are the goals of this lession. These are typically written as \"After this lesson the student...: Difficulty Level - is it a Beginner, Intermediate or Difficult concept? For example drawing a square with a turtle is a Beginner concept. Recursion is a Difficult concept. Sample Code - Please provide working sample code that you have tested whenever possible. We encourage you to put in in-line comments when possible. Experiments - What additional experiments could the students do? Could they intergrate other prior concepts? Using Markdown formats \u00b6 We strongly suggest you submit your contributions using Markdown format. There are tools that will convert MS-Word into Markdown format.","title":"How to Contribute Examples"},{"location":"contribute/#how-to-contribute-to-our-learning-python-library","text":"We are an all-volunteer organization.

A turtle is a drawing object that has position, direction and a pen to draw as it moves around a grid. They are a great way to teach students about the concepts of programming. Initializaton commands \u00b6 There are three lines that will appear at the top of these labs: 1 2 3 import turtle t = turtle . Turtle () t . shape ( 'turtle' ) The first line loads the turtle library into our program. The second creates a new turtle object called \"t\". The third line sets the shape to be a turtle. You don't have to use the name \"t\". You can set your turtle's name to be whatever you want. For example you can call your turtle \"sue\". 1 2 3 import turtle sue = turtle . Turtle () t . shape ( 'turtle' ) Moving the Turtle \u00b6 There a five basic ways to move your turtle around the screen. Our screen is approximatly 300 points wide and 400 points high. The point (0,0) is at the center of our screen. The first four are relative commands. The last one will move the turtle to the absolute x and y location. t.forward(40) t.back(40) t.left(90) t.right(90) t.goto(x,y) Drawing \u00b6 There are several ways to draw virtual \"ink\" on the screen. The most common way is to just move your turtle around. It will draw a thin black line by default. t.penup() t.pendown() t.color('red') t.pensize(5) t.begin_fill() - begin filling a region you draw around t.end_fill() - end the fill region Shapes \u00b6 There are also a few built-in drawing functions. -t.circle(10) Misc \u00b6 There are also a few other miscellanious things you can do.
