This includes hints on getting your Python environments setup up and extensive lesson plans for serveral enviornments. Our mentors have used several different envornments for teaching Python. They each have pros and cons. What our mentors like is getting new students started using a graphical programming environment such as turtle graphics libraries. Here are some of our favorite tools: Trinket.io is an easy-to use, kid friendly web-based turtle graphics for beginners. Jupyter Notebooks also have some support for turtle graphics. Jupyter Notebooks can be tricky to setup for the first time, but they are the perfect on-ramp for teaching data literacy. Raspberry Pi - The Raspberry Pi foundation has selected Python as its primary tool for teaching programming. If you have a Raspberry Pi there are many resources for you. Trinket and Jupyter Notebooks will also run on many Raspberry Pi devices. Robots Our students love robots. Python is also the preferred language in many robotics courses. Today we teach beginning robotics with Scratch and Arduio, but we continue to investigate systems like Raspberry Pi robots that can be programmed with Python. Let us know if you have any low-cost kid friendly ideas. We have tested the JetBot and other robots and we continue to look for solutions. Now lets briefly go into the pros and cons of these systems. Learing Python with Trinket We use the trinket.io web site to teach our introduction to python. Trinket has a nice turtle graphics library which is ideal for fast visual feedback. Because it is a free and a pure web web based environment it meets the criteria for our courses. There is no complex setup and each student can continue to do development when they are at home. The downside of Trinket is it has limited functionality and you must have an internet connection to use Trinket. Learning Python with Jupyter Notebooks You can also use Jupyter Notebooks to draw turtle graphics. The notebook will open a new window to draw your turtle graphis. Getting Jupyter Notebooks is a bit tricky to setup on many PCs. However, once it is setup it offers tens of thousands of sample programs to learn python coding. Jupyter Notebooks are also the preferred tool by many data science professionals. An example of a Jupyter Notebook that uses turtle graphs is here Learning Python with Raspberry Pi If you have a Rasperry Pi there are many great ways to learn Python. One of first things is to try out one of the Python development environments for the Raspberry Pi. Learning Python with Robots Right now we are continuing to try to find the right combination of easy-of-use and low-cost robots to teach python. If you hear of any good tools, please let us know. Target Audience Learning Python is ideal for students that have good keyboarding skills. If students have difficulty with doing functions like copy and pasting text we suggest they start with a block-programming language like Scratch. List of Concepts Here are some of the concepts we will be learning in this course. If you are already familiar with these concepts you can skip over some of the labs. importing libraries We need to tell Pyhton what functions we want to use. We will use the import function to tell Python which functions we need to use in our programs. drawing Turtle graphs has a set of drawing functions. We will learn to use these to draw patterns on the screen. square walk - teach your turtle to walk in a square and draw figures. variables Variables make our programs easier to read and easier to understand. loops Loops help use when we have many tasks that we repeat over and over. conditionals Conditionals allow us to change our behavior based on rules we create. functions Functions allow us to break large programs into chunks that we can give names and can call over and over. function parameters Functions can also take parameters to change the behavior of a function. random numbers Random number functions allow our programs to have the computer select new random number between a range of numbers. lists Lists alow us to create collections of names. inputs Inputs allow us to prompt the user for values. recursion Recursion allows us to have programs call themselves to create repeating patterns. modules Once you have a group of related functions you can put them all together into a module. This makes it easier for others to reuse your programs. Contributing to Our Library Do you have a specific example you would like to share with other students and teachers?

So we don't yet have any paid staff to curate new content. However, we do value your input and will consider all contributions as our volunteer time permits. We especially value teachers that would like to integrate coding, data science and AI into your classrooms in new and innovative ways. Using Standard Git Pull Requests The best way to contribute is to send use your sample programs using a standard GitHub pull request method. This allow us to view all the changes you are proposing and give you feedback. This is a three step process. 1. The first step will require you to have your own github account. You can go to our github home page and look for the \"fork\" icon. When you click that it will make a \"virutal copy\" in your own github area. 2. You can then add your content to that repository and do all the testing there. 3. Once you have everything tested you can click the \"Submit Pull Request\". This process will notify our team your additon is pending. We will review these new submission and if everything looks OK we will accept your changes. We might suggest a few changes the first time you send us a pull request. Don't take this personally. We want to make working on-line togeher as semaless as possible and helping put the right sections in place to start is a normal part of working in teams on line. Good Lesson Plans A good contribution has some, but not necessarily all of the following: Context - where does this lession fit into our overall cirriculum? Would it normally follow after an existing lession or is it a standalone lesson? Concepts - what concept will be taught in this lesson. We try to keep to the idea of \"One concept per lesson\". So think about what is the minimum amount of code to learn a new concept. Learning Objective - what are the goals of this lession. These are typically written as \"After this lesson the student...: Difficulty Level - is it a Beginner, Intermediate or Difficult concept? For example drawing a square with a turtle is a Beginner concept. Recursion is a Difficult concept. Sample Code - Please provide working sample code that you have tested whenever possible. We encourage you to put in in-line comments when possible. To use our test highlighter for Python code, please place your code in a block sourrounded by back quotes. Use the word \"python\" on the like with the first backquotes. See Examples Here Experiments - What additional experiments could the students do? Could they intergrate other prior concepts? Using Markdown formats We strongly suggest you submit your contributions using Markdown format. There are tools that will convert MS-Word into Markdown format. See the Markdown Cheat Sheet for tips to get started with Markdown. Converting MS-Word to Markdown format If you have content in Microsoft Word and you use a Windows PC, you can use the Writage plugin to convert your documents. For Mac users you can use the PanDoc program to convert MS-Word into Markdown.

By combining turtle graphics with Jupyter you get the best of both worlds. Two Ways to View Turtle Graphics There are two ways to view turtle graphics in Jupyter: With the turtle being drawn in a separate window With the turtle being drawn \"inline\" directly under your code In general, inline is preferred because you can keep track of many small exercises just by scrolling down. You can also print out the notebooks to show others your work. In many of these labs we will be using a special version of the turtle library that was developed by Thomas Kluyver from the UK called the \"mobilechelonian\". We want to thank him for this work.

A turtle is a drawing object that has position, direction and a pen to draw as it moves around a grid. Turtle graphic are the preferred way to teach many concepts in computer science because they give you fast feedback. For many of our introductary python labs we will use the turtle python library. Although there are many different versions of the turtle library, most of the commands are similar. What you learn with the trinket python system will be useful in other sytems also. Initializaton commands There are three lines that will appear at the top of these labs: import turtle t = turtle . Turtle () t . shape ( 'turtle' ) The first line loads the turtle library into our program. The second creates a new turtle object called \"t\". The third line sets the shape to be a turtle. You don't have to use the name \"t\". You can set your turtle's name to be whatever you want. For example you can call your turtle \"sue\". import turtle sue = turtle . Turtle () sue . shape ( 'turtle' ) Just make sure you change all the names in the file to reference your new name. Moving the Turtle There a five basic ways to move your turtle around the screen. Our screen is approximatly 300 points wide and 400 points high. The point (0,0) is at the center of our screen. The first four are relative commands. The last one will move the turtle to the absolute x and y location. t.forward(40) t.back(40) t.left(90) t.right(90) t.goto(x,y) Drawing There are several ways to draw virtual \"ink\" on the screen. The most common way is to just move your turtle around.
