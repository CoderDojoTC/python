# Getting Starts With Trinket

These labs assume that you have internet access and a modern web browser such as Chrome.

We use the [Trinket web site](https://trinket.io/) because it a kid-save place that has many of the basic turtle drawing libraries implemented in and easy-to-use web environment.  It is appropriate for students just getting started with python programming but has limited libraries for our advanced data analysis and plotting labs.  The free version is limited to the older Python 2.X functionality, but this meets all the needs of our beginning python class.
