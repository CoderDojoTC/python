## Introduction to Turtle Graphics with Trinket
These labs assume that you have internet access and a modern web browser such as Chrome.

We use the [Trinket web site](http://trniket.io) because it has many of the basic turtle drawing libraries implemented in and easy-to-use web envornment.  It is apropriate for students just getting started with python programming but has limited libraries for our advanced data analysis and plotting labs.

## List of Trinket Python Labs
Our labs are working sample programs that you can try.  You can learn by reading the sample programs and changing some values in the code.  Each of the labs has experiments you can do to extend the code in various ways.
