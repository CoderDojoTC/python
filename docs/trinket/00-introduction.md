# Introduction 

## Introduction to Turtle Graphics with Trinket

These labs assume that you have internet access and a modern web browser such as Chrome.

We use the [Trinket web site](https://trinket.io/) because it has many of the basic turtle drawing libraries implemented in and easy-to-use web environment.  It is appropriate for students just getting started with python programming but has limited libraries for our advanced data analysis and plotting labs.  The free
version is limited to the older Python 2.X functionality.  If you want to try another web-based system that support turtle graphics and Python 3.X we suggest the web site [repl.it](http://repl.it)

## List of Trinket Python Learning Labs
For students that are new to programming, here are some sample programs (what we call learning labs) that you can try.  You can learn by reading the sample programs, going to the Trinkit.io site and changing some values in the code.  Each of the labs has experiments at the end you can do to extend to see if you have mastered the concepts before you go on to the next lab.

1. [Turtle graphics](./01-turtle-graphics.md) - introduction to the Turtle Graphs library with a list of drawing functions
2. [Simple square](./02-simple-square.md) - draw a square by moving and turning right four times
4. [Variables](./03-variables.md) - add variables for the move edge distance and angle
5. [Loops](./04-loops.md) - add a loop to make our code smaller
6. [Conditionals](./05-conditionals.md) - add an if statement to change the color
7. [Functions](./06-functions.md) - create a shape function
8. [Function parameters](./07-function-parameters.md) - add parameters to our function
9. [Random](./08-random.md) - generate random numbers
9. [Lists](./08-list.md) - store a list of colors
10. [Inputs](./11-input.md) - get some input from the user
11. [Recursion](./12-recursion.md) - create a function that calls itself

## Additional Labs
In addition to our core labs, here are a few other labs that your students might find fun:
