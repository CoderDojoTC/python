## Introduction to Turtle Graphics with Trinket
These labs assume that you have internet access and a modern web browser such as Chrome.

We use the [Trinket web site](http://trniket.io) because it has many of the basic turtle drawing libraries implemented in and easy-to-use web envornment.  It is apropriate for students just getting started with python programming but has limited libraries for our advanced data analysis and plotting labs.  If you want to try another web-based system that support turtle graphics we suggest the web site [repl.it](http://repl.it)

## List of Trinket Python Learning Labs
For students that are new to programming, here are some sample programs (what we call learning labs) that you can try.  You can learn by reading the sample programs, goint to the Trinkit.io site and changing some values in the code.  Each of the labs has experiments at the end you can do to extend to see if you have mastered the concepts before you go on to the next lab.
