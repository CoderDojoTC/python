## Changing background and using keys to move the rocket

We can use trinkets to change the background and change the shape of the turtle with a custom image.
Also we can control the screen with the mouse. It gives a starting point for how to create a game.

The following blog lays out the steps for creating a rocket ship

The images have to be the same size as the the screen size. Here are some other images that have been resized.

## Experiments
1. Can you map another keyboard key to take some other actions like jump, draw a circle.
2. Use different images and create backgrounds of your choice, like rocketpanda gliding through night sky
