## Drawing a Simple Square
The following code is an example of drawing a square using turtle graphics.

## Sample Code
```
import turtle
dan = turtle.Turtle()
dan.shape('turtle')

dan.forward(40)
dan.right(90)

dan.forward(40)
dan.right(90)

dan.forward(40)
dan.right(90)

dan.forward(40)
dan.right(90)
   
dan.write('done with square')
```

## Explaination
The first three lines will be the same for all our programs.  They import the turtle library into our program, create a new turtle object and then assign the turtle a shape icon.

## Experiments
Can you change the distance and angle the turtle moves?  What happens when you change the numbers for the forward and right functions?

Can you add more motion commands using copy and paste?
