## turtle graphics
The following code is an example of drawing a square using turtle graphics.

```
import turtle
dan = turtle.Turtle()
dan.shape('turtle')

dan.forward(40)
dan.right(90)

dan.forward(40)
dan.right(90)

dan.forward(40)
dan.right(90)

dan.forward(40)
dan.right(90)
   
dan.write('done with square')
```

The first three lines will be the same for all our programs.  They import the turtle library into our program, create a new turtle object and then assign the turtle a shape icon.
