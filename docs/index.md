# CoderDojo Twin Cities Python Resources
This GitHub repository is for sharing resources to teach Python.

## Trinket
We use the [trinket.io](http://trinket.io) web site to teach introduction to python.  Trinket has a nice turtle graphics library which is ideal for fast visual feedback.

## Target Audience
- Students that have good keyboarding skills and are new to Python.
Note: Students must have an Internet/web connection to use these labs.

## Concepts
1. [turtle graphics](trinket/01-turtle-graphics)
2. [simple square](trinket/02-simple-square)
4. [variables](trinket/03-variables)
5. [loops](trinket/04-loops)
6. [conditionals](trinket/05-conditionals)
7. [functions](trinket/06-functions)
8. [function parameters](trinket/07-parameters)
9. [lists](trinket/08-lists)
10. [inputs](trinket/09-inputs)
11. [recursion](trinket/10-loops)

## List of labs

- [**square walk**] - teach your turtle to walk in a square
- [**distance variable**] - use a variable to store distance
- [**loops**] use a for loop to make the turtle go forward and turn four times.  We use the 
- [**conditional colors**]

## Things to try
- Can you make your turtle draw a triangle?  Try having it turn 120 degrees three times
