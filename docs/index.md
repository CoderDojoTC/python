# CoderDojo Twin Cities Python Resources
This GitHub repository is for sharing resources to teach Python.  We have used two different envornments for teaching Python: Trinket.io and Jypyter Notebooks.  Each has its strengths and weaknesses.

## Trinket
We use the [trinket.io](http://trinket.io) web site to teach introduction to python.  Trinket has a nice turtle graphics library which is ideal for fast visual feedback.

## Jupyter Notebook
You can also use Jupyter Notebooks to draw turtle graphics.  The notebook will open a new window to draw your turtle graphis.  Getting Jupyter Notebooks is a bit tricky to setup on many PCs.  However, once it is setup it offers tens of thousands of sample programs to learn python coding.  Jupyter Notebooks are also the preferred tool by many data science professionals.
An example of a Jupyter Notebook that uses turtle graphs is [here](jupyter/draw-figure.ipynb)

## Target Audience
- Students that have good keyboarding skills and are new to Python.
Note: Students must have an Internet/web connection to use these labs.

## List of Concepts
Here are some of the concepts we will be learning in this course.  If you are already familiar with these concepts you can skip over some of the labs.

- **importing libraries** We need to tell Pyhton what functions we want to use.  We will use the import function to tell Python which functions we need to use in our programs.
- **drawing** Turtle graphs has a set of drawing functions.  We will learn to use these to draw patterns on the screen.
- **square walk** - teach your turtle to walk in a square and draw figures.
- **variables** Variables make our programs easier to read and easier to understand.
- **loops** Loops help use when we have many tasks that we repeat over and over.
- **conditionals** Conditionals allow us to change our behavior based on rules we create.
- **functions**  Functions allow us to break large programs into chunks that we can give names and can call over and over.
- **function parameters**  Functions can also take parameters to change the behavior of a function.
- **random numbers**  Random number functions allow our programs to have the computer select new random number between a range of numbers.
- **lists** Lists alow us to create collections of names.
- **inputs**  Inputs allow us to prompt the user for values.
- **recursion**  Recursion allows us to have programs call themselves to create repeating patterns.
